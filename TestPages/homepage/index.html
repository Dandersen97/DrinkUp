Turn your shirt inside out the rest of the night or 2. Take 1 drink. This isn't very bad hence a low punishment. Likewise your task could be 1. Let the person to your right sharpie whatever they want to your face or 2. Take 5 drinks. This could be very severe, especially if there is trust issues, hence a larger punishment. But don't assume easy equals safe, if a task is so simple and easy you may have to drink much more because it's just so easy. Like Say the word 'cheese' or take 10 drinks.
